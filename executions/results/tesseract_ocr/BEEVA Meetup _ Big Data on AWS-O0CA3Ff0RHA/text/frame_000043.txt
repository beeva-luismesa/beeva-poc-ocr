AWS Redshift — Things to consider

Load data with the COPY command instead of INSERT
Run VACUUM command to reorganize your data and handle free
space.

Access to the last snapshot, not needed to wait until all data is
committed.

Security on a User, Group and Schema level.

Fine tuning through configuration on the workload management
(WLM)

User-defined functions: write specific Python programs to
implement non—SQL processing. Python programs are stored on the
Redshift cluster and available for any user with granted access.
