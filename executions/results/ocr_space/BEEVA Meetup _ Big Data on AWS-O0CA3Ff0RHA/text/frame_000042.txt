AWS Redshift - Things to consider 
Design your tables carefully (massively parallel processing) 
Column compression type: it reduces the size of the data to 
read and improves query performance. 
Data distribution: data is distributed among rows of the table 
on the computes nodes. So it affects to queries performance. 
Sort keys: Redshift uses sort keys within each table. If defined 
right, sort keys can improve query predicates execution 
(skipping potentially lots of rows) 
Define constraints: uniqueness, primary keys and foreign keys 
are not enforced but give hints to the query planner improving 
execution time.
