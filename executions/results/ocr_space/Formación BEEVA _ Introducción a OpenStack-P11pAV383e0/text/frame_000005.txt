Openstack introduction 
vii. OpenStack History 
The oriqin 
OpenStack was created during the first months of 2010. Rackspace wanted to rewrite the 
infrastructure code running its Cloud servers offering, and considered open sourcing the existing 
Cloud files code. At the same time, Anso Labs (contracting for NASA) had published beta code 
for Nova, a Python-based "cloud computing fabric controller". 
Both efforts converged and formed the base for OpenStack. The first Design Summit was held in 
Austin, T X on July 13-14, 2010, and the projectwas officially announced at OSCON in Portland, 
OR, on July 21st, 2010. 
The mission 
The OpenStack mission is "to produce the ubiquitous Open Source Cloud Computing platform 
that Will meet the needs of public and private clouds regardless of size, by being simple to 
implementand massively scalable". 
It appeared on the wiki on May 24th, 2010 and Still captures the long-term goal of the OpenStack 
community.
