Openstack introduction 
v. Cloud Capacity 
"One of the main reasons for using cloud 
computing services is to get efficiency and cost 
savings. And maximum IT efficiency on the cloud 
comes from good capacity planning and 
management," Kotsovinos said at the Cloud 
Expo Europe 2013 event. But it is Still the most 
overlooked and underestimated aspect of the 
cloud, he said. 
It is all OK when you are doing cloud on a small 
scale, but when you do it at a high level for 
applicationsthat are disparate and mission- 
critical, it is important to think about storage 
requirements and think about demand and 
supply to provision correctly
