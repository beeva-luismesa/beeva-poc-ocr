vi. OpenStack History
The origin
OpenStack was created during the first months of 2010 Rackspace to the
wanted rewrite
infrastructure code running its cloud servers offering and considered open sourcing the existing
Cloud files code At the same time, Anso Labs (contracting for NASA) had published beta code
for Nova, a Python-based "cloud computing fabric controller
Both efforts converged and formed the base for OpenStack The first Design Summit was held in
Austin, TX on July 13-14, 2010, and the project was officially announced at OSCON in Portland,
OR on July 21st, 2010
The mission
The OpenStack mission is to produce the ubiquitous Open Source Cloud Computing platform
that will meet the needs of public and private clouds regardless of size by being simple to
implement and massively scalable
It appeared on the wiki on May 24th, 2010 and still captures the long-term goal of the OpenStack
community
