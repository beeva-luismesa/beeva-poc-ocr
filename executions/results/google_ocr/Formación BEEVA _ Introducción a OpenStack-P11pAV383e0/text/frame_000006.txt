VI. OpenStack History
vi, OpenStack History
The origin
OpenStack was created during the first months of 2010. Rackspade wanted to rewrite the
infrastructure code running its cloud servers, oitering and considered open sourcing the existing
Cloud files code. At the same time Ansa Labs (contacting for NASA) had published beta code
for Nova, a Pythonbased cloud computing fabric controller
Both efforts converged and formed the base for OpenStack. The first Design Summit was held in
TAustin, TX on July 13-14, 2010, and the project was officially announced at OSCON in Portland
OR, on July 21st 2010 in Santo Do Source and Congo and Santorm
The mission salad
The OpenStack mission is to PRduce the ubiquitous Open Source Cloud Computing platform
that will meet the needs of public and private clouds regardless of size, by being simple to
implement and massively scalable
It appeared on the wiki on his 24th, 2010 and still captures the long-term goal of the OpenStack
community.
